## Purpose:
- Sell things, mostly at cost.
- If I inflate prices, then I'll document how I'm doing so, to what amounts, and why.
- Just a transparent supply chain.
- Ideally run off donations. If not enough donations, I can potentially add a minimal "donation fee" to cover operation costs to items sold.
- Allows me to sell things I'm interested in to people - Direct to Consumer transactions.
- Build my network of people looking at things I'm interested.
- Promote Monero as a payment option.
- Also maybe get community involved. Like could get Homeless people, Elderly, or children, to solder some Dactyl Manuforms together for people, and they can make some money, and help out. Then when order is shipped, they can include a polaroid, saying "Assembled by X", to make it more personal. Just a way people can contribute, in a wholesome way, without doing acquiring labor through arbitrage techniques via people in undeveloped countries.

## Long Term Vision:
- Have an automated fulfillment system, for fulfilling orders (open source warehouse, and distribution).
  - So for electronic kits, have parts stored, conveyor belts, and have resistors bagged, arduinoes bagged, etc. Maybe even have it pack boxes automatically.
  - Have a way to automatically lube mechinical keyboard switches.
- Expand to holding other assets, such as forests, and selling fruits from that. Then I can sell X amount of firewood, maintain land, and be the caretaker of the land.
  - (Maybe also help wildlife, add sensors, raise bees, grow food and sell food, etc).
